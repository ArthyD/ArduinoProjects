# ArduinoProjects

These are my Arduino projects made with an Arduino Uno, an Arduino Mega and a MKR1010

## Arduino basics

These projects are basic programs to do analog/digital measure, use the different communication protocols.

## Arduino FreeRTOS

These projects aim to use freeRTOS in different scenarios.

## MKR1010

These projects are basic programs for Aduino Wifi to connect to networks, create a simple web server, create an access point.
