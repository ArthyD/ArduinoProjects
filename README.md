# ArduinoProjects

These are my Arduino projects made with an Arduino Uno, an Arduino Mega and a MKR1010. Most basic projects are about monitoring the environment of a plant using a digital temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11) and an analog soil moisture sensor.

## Arduino basics

These projects are basic programs to do analog/digital measure, use the different communication protocols.

## Arduino FreeRTOS

These projects aim to use freeRTOS in different scenarios.

## MKR1010

These projects are basic programs for Aduino Wifi to connect to networks, create a simple web server, create an access point.
